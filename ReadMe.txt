Description:
In this university coursework project, I developed a Gradebook system, which allows managing student grades for three modules: CW001, EX002, and CE003. The system accommodates different assessment patterns for each module, ensuring accurate and efficient grade management.

The Gradebook project is implemented using object-oriented programming principles, including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, to provide a robust and maintainable solution for a real-world scenario.

Key Features:
Individual classes for each module type, ensuring code modularity and reusability.
Student class to store student information and manage grades across modules.
Prompting user interface for displaying module marks in tabular form.

Technologies Used:
Java: The primary programming language for implementing the Gradebook system.
Object-Oriented Programming: Applying OOP principles to design and structure the project.
GitHub: The version control platform used to host and share the codebase.

Getting Started:
Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/mohaammed17/Gradebook.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd Gradebook
Run the main script to execute the Gradebook program:  Main.java

PS: please refer to the "Scenario" file for the overview of the project.
